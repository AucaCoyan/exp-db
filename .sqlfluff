# The standard max_line_length is 80 in line with the convention of
# other tools and several style guides. Many projects however prefer
# something a little longer.
# Set to zero or negative to disable checks.
max_line_lenth = 120

# The default configuration for capitalisation rules is "consistent"
# which will auto-detect the setting from the rest of the file. This
# is less desirable in a new project and you may find this (slightly
# more strict) setting more useful.
# Typically we find users rely on syntax highlighting rather than
# capitalisation to distinguish between keywords and identifiers.
# Clearly, if your organisation has already settled on uppercase
# formatting for any of these syntax elements then set them to "upper".
